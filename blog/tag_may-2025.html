<p>I just spent 2 hrs troubleshooting apache server issues for my entire class after getting the lab done in like, 30 minutes lol. Turns out apache is really easy! You just gotta know that you don't fuck with linux! If it has no space, you do <b>NOT</b> add a space unless you want to cause problems.</p>
<p>DocumentRoot =/ Document Root, and you need to write out exactly what the conf wants!<b> READ!!! PLEASE READ!!!</b></p>
<p>Either way, really good practice-- I really, really wanna stay proficient with Linux this time, using Linux a few years back was really nice and the problems it has are super overstated imo. Though, I guess that depends on distro.</p>

<p>It all formats fine but holy shit I look like an 8 year old typing out what they want to be when they grow up</p>

Test of the blog-- Maybe I should learn vim?

<p>This post is being written using <b>NANO</b>. I should probably learn to use <b>VIM</b>, as it does seem like it can do a lot more, much quicker, but I worry that getting used to VIM will make me age a billion years in a second, telling my partners that I can't use Netflix because they use too much DRM for my tastes. But who knows-- Maybe there's some magic resource out there that makes vim super easy to use over Nano or gives me better appreciation for its feaatures.</p>

<p>Until then, I think I'm going to stick with Nano. As part of my college classes, I'm figuring out Apache servers tomorrow and a bunch of other Linux server related topics, and my eventual goal when it comes to home server use is to have my own image filehost that I use, as I've been burned before by one going down permanently, and the one I'm currently using worries me as to what I can or can't upload and is a bit of a pain. </p>

<p>I'm wondering how this formatting looks, since all of this is being written in Nano and I can't preview it without being annoyed.</p>
