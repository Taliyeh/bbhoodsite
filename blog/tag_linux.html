<p>This post is being written using <b>NANO</b>. I should probably learn to use <b>VIM</b>, as it does seem like it can do a lot more, much quicker, but I worry that getting used to VIM will make me age a billion years in a second, telling my partners that I can't use Netflix because they use too much DRM for my tastes. But who knows-- Maybe there's some magic resource out there that makes vim super easy to use over Nano or gives me better appreciation for its feaatures.</p>

<p>Until then, I think I'm going to stick with Nano. As part of my college classes, I'm figuring out Apache servers tomorrow and a bunch of other Linux server related topics, and my eventual goal when it comes to home server use is to have my own image filehost that I use, as I've been burned before by one going down permanently, and the one I'm currently using worries me as to what I can or can't upload and is a bit of a pain. </p>

<p>I'm wondering how this formatting looks, since all of this is being written in Nano and I can't preview it without being annoyed.</p>
