<p>I know this is common for people in Business, but holy shit is my professor for business nuts. I can vaguely understand why it's a part of my IT program, to a degree, in the same way why I can understand why we have technical writing and communications course. Soft skills are huge in this industry and I understand that. </p>

<p>But <b>holy shit</b>, I can't begin to understand what a first assignment about the US/China/Canada trade war even has to do with our field? </p>
<p>> Yeah bud, you didn't close your bracket there-- Something tells me it might be due to the rising costs of importing goods from china, though. </p>
<p>And of course, he's a Libertarian who spent the entire class getting mad about regulations and bringing up the fucking car seat birthrate thing. Nobody cares about the car seat birth rate thing! Every fucking Libertarian brings this up! Why don't you talk about the roads next! </p>
<p>On the bright side, however... I made this. </p>
